title:  "Announcing: Timing71 Desktop Client"
---

I'm pleased to announce that the new Timing71 Desktop Client is now [available
for download](https://www.timing71.org/download) for Windows and Linux!

The Desktop Client brings all the features of
[timing71.org](https://www.timing71.org) to your desktop, plus adds extra
desktop-only functionality:

- Load and view replays and analysis offline
- Start and run a timing service plugin locally
- Connect to a timing service plugin remotely

Those last two will be made possible with the forthcoming open-sourcing of the
[livetiming-core library]({% link opensource.md %}#livetiming-core-coming-soon),
allowing developers to write their own plugins to create new data sources using
the Timing71 data format.

Timing71 remains a not-for-profit hobby project, and I hope this new client will
be useful.

### Why no Mac release?

In order to create an installable Mac client, I'd need access to Macintosh
hardware, and I don't consider that the best way to spend people's donations
that keep this project running. If there's demand, I might consider adding a Mac
build in the future.
