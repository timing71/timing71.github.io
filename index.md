**Timing71** (formerly the Live Timing Aggregator) is a motorsport live timing
aggregation, processing, and analysis system. It has many disparate moving
parts - this site is an attempt to document and catalogue them, including the
Common Timing Data formats at the heart of the system.

This documentation is aimed at developers. There's a user help page
[on the main Timing71 site](https://www.timing71.org/help).

Throughout 2020 I'm working to [open source]({% link opensource.md %}) parts of
the system. The various codebases will be documented here as I'm able to
release them.

- [View open-source projects]({% link opensource.md %})
- [View reference materials]({% link reference.md %})

This documentation is at a very early stage. Please check back to see progress!
