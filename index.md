title: Welcome to the Timing71 documentation

**Timing71** (formerly the Live Timing Aggregator) is a motorsport live timing
aggregation, processing, and analysis system.

Timing71 can obtain live timing data from a timing service provider, convert it
into the Common Timing Data format, then republish that data via a local server
or via the Internet along with real-time analysis. The Timing71 network provides
timing replays and post-session analysis too.

The Timing71 network is run as a hobby project, by a motorsport fan, and not for
profit. It is funded through generous donations from the motorsports community.

## For fans

Using the [Timing71 website](https://www.timing71.org) or
[desktop client](https://www.timing71.org/download) you can keep track of your
favourite drivers and cars during a race; or pull up a live timing replay to
watch alongside a video race replay. You have access to the same detailed
analysis tools used by race teams and commentators.

<div>
## For sim racing

A new **iRacing plugin** is now available, which is able to send live
timing data directly from your iRacing session to a local
[desktop client](https://www.timing71.org/download) or even to the Timing71
website. Drop an email to [iracing@timing71.org](mailto:iracing@timing71.org) to
find out more.

## For race organisers

The Timing71 network can expand your online reach and allow your fans to engage
on a deeper level with every moment of every session.

We already have integrations with many at-track timing service providers,
building on their own web timing offerings by adding real-time strategy analysis
and message feed for significant race events. Championships such as the European
Le Mans Series have appreciated the service that this provides for fans wanting
to dig deeper into race strategy.

If you'd like to have your events covered on the Timing71 network,
[get in touch](mailto:james@timing71.org).

## For developers

Throughout 2020 I'm working to [open source]({% link opensource.md %}) parts of
the system. The various codebases will be documented here as I'm able to
release them. This documentation is at a very early stage. Please check back to
see progress!
